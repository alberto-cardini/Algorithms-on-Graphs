    "# Best First Search Algorithm\n",
    "The Best First Search is a graph search algorithm based on a priority queue, called **frontier**, that holds the possible nodes corresponding to a given goal. Whether the current node is the goal or must be expanded is decided according to a heuristic, if is the informed version of the algorithm, or to a blind policy like: FIFO, LIFO or Uniform Cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm generalize the concept of searching for a goal in graph, indeed, in the same pseudocode there are BFS, DFS and Dijkstra depending on the chosen blind policy of extraction. When a heuristic is added and minor changes are implemented, the algorithm becomes A-star. Let's look up at the code."

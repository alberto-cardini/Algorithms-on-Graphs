## Best First Search
Best-First Search is an informed search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising node chosen according to a specified rule. It uses a priority queue to keep track of nodes to be explored, prioritizing them based on a heuristic function that estimates the cost to reach the goal from each node.
